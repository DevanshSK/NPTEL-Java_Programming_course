# **Lecture Notes: Java Demonstration V**

## **Introduction**

- Previous module covered static scope role in Java and basic understanding of writing recursive programs.
- This demonstration aims to illustrate different concepts regarding scope rules and recursive program writing.
- Recap of basic control structures such as loops (while, do-while, for) and switch-case statements.

## **Loop Structures**

- Different types of loop structures introduced.
- **While Loop**:
    - Example: Print odd numbers using a while loop.
    - Loop continues until the value of **`count`** is less than 11.
    - Prints odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
    - Demonstrated compilation and execution.
- **Do-While Loop**:
    - Similar to while loop, but condition is checked at the end.
    - Example: Print even numbers using a do-while loop.
- **For Loop**:
    - Used for loop initialization, condition checking, and updating loop variables.
    - Example: Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
- **Break and Continue Statements**:
    - **`break`**: Terminates loop prematurely based on a condition.
    - **`continue`**: Skips the remaining part of the loop's current iteration.

## **Control Structures**

- **If-Else Statement**:
    - Simple decision structure in Java.
    - Based on a condition, execute different code blocks.
- **Switch-Case Statement**:
    - Used for multiple decision checking.
    - Demonstrated with an example of a simple program taking user input and responding with different cases.

## **Scope Rules**

- Scope defines the visibility and accessibility of variables in different parts of the program.
- **Static Scope Rule**: Discussed in detail.
    - Variables declared within a block are only accessible within that block.
    - Demonstrated with examples showing variable scope within different blocks.
- **Class Variables and Instance Variables**:
    - Java doesn't have true global variables.
    - Class variables (static variables) shared among all instances of a class.
    - Instance variables belong to individual instances.
- **Class Methods and Instance Methods**:
    - Class methods can be invoked without creating an object.
    - Instance methods require an object for invocation.

## **Recursive Programs**

- Recursive programs call themselves to solve problems.
- **Factorial Calculation**:
    - Recursively calculate factorial of a number.
    - Demonstrated with program taking input and printing factorials.
- **Fibonacci Series**:
    - Recursively calculate Fibonacci series.
    - Program takes input and prints Fibonacci numbers.
- **GCD Calculation**:
    - Recursively calculate greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
    - Demonstrated with user input.
- **Counter Recursive Example**:
    - Recursive method with a counter to show recursion and termination.
    - Demonstrated stack-like behavior of recursion.

## **Conclusion**

- Importance of practice in understanding and mastering Java programming concepts.
- Recap of covered concepts and encouragement to continue practicing and exploring Java programming.
