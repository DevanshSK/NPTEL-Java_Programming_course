# Lecture Notes: ****Basic Concept of Java Programming****

## **Introduction**

- Welcome to the course, the first lecture on Basic Concepts of Java Programming.
- The course is taught by Debasis Samanta from IIT Kharagpur, with support from Research Scholars Tauheed Med and Niranjan Sinhababu acting as TAs.
- Feel free to ask questions on the discussion forum or via email.

## **Reference Materials**

- Recommended books:
    - "Complete Reference Java 2" (10th Edition, Tata Mc-GrawHill Indian edition).
    - "Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and Java" (Prentice Hall of India, written by Debasis Samanta).

## **Course Overview**

- The course consists of 60 lectures spread over 12 weeks.
- Each week covers specific topics, with demonstrations to deepen understanding.
- The final week (week 12) includes a mini-project to apply the skills learned in the course.

## **Brief History of Java Programming**

- Java was introduced in 1991 by the Green Team from Sun Microsystems.
- Initially called Greentalk, it was later named Java in 1995.
- Java was designed for embedded systems but evolved into a popular programming language.
- Java's popularity led to the release of JDK (Java Development Kit) in January 1996.

## **Features of Java Programming**

- Java is simple, portable, secure, high-performance, multithreaded, interpreted, platform-independent, dynamic, architecturally neutral, and object-oriented.
- According to popularity scores, Java stands as the most popular programming language.

## **Programming Paradigms**

1. Function-Oriented Programming
    - Organizes the program into small functions with shared global data.
    - Follows the top-down approach.
    - Examples: C, C++, etc.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    - Organizes the program into a set of objects, each with its data and methods.
    - Follows the bottom-up approach.
    - Examples: Java, C#, C++, etc.

## **Java Programming Paradigms**

1. Encapsulation
    - In OOP, a class encapsulates both data and methods.
    - A class is responsible for building objects.
2. Inheritance
    - Allows a class to derive from an existing class (base class) and create subclasses (derived class).
    - Subclasses inherit data and methods from the base class.
3. Information Hiding
    - Controls access to certain methods or data, making them not easily accessible to the public.
4. Polymorphism
    - The ability of a method to execute different operations based on its context.
    - Allows methods with the same name but different arguments to perform different tasks.

## **Java Programming Categories**

1. Java Core Programming
    - Suitable for developing system and application software.
    - Involves multithreading, interfaces, input/output handling, Java Beans, packages, and exception handling.
2. Java Applet Programming
    - Used for developing graphical user interfaces (GUI) for operating systems and applications.
    - Utilizes Java multimedia, Java Script, Windows Toolkit, and Java Swing.
3. Internet Programming
    - Involves networking, distributed programming (client-server model), database connectivity (JDBC), and Java Server Pages (JSP) for web development.

These are the key concepts covered in this lecture on Basic Concepts of Java Programming. In the following lectures, we will delve deeper into each topic.
